<h1>About</h1>
<p>Inspired by Ananda, the Buddha's personal secretary with a photographic memory, DharmaTime will create a log of your meditation sessions.</p>

<p>This app is built on the MEAN stack: it stores your archive in a MongoDB database, AngularJS displays the contents, and Express and Node.js manages the client/server interactions.</p>

<p>This app was created by Jeffrey Eaton.</p>
